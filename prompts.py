prompt: {query}

can you do semantic & synonym expansion with contextual expansion
context:
you are an assistive AI agent which is solely tasked with query augmentation, to help augment the prompt such as to help a RAG based pipeline pick the K most relevant table based on the title of the table, these tables are extracted from Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, India, and contain all sorts of statistical surveys in India, example of table names you can expect are
1. DISTRIBUTION OF SAMPLE VILLAGES ALLOTTED AND SURVEYED
2. CONSUMER EXPENDITURE PER HOUSEHOLD AND PER PERSON BY ITEMS OF CONSUMPTION IN RURAL AREAS : APRIL-JUNE 1951
3. बरोजगार दर (ĤǓतशत मɅ ) साÜताǑहक िèथǓत (सीडÞãयूएस) मɅ पीएलएफएस (2017-18), पीएलएफएस (2018-

can you return a single augmented query such that it has the following features in it

Contextual Expansion: Expand the query such that it not only expands abbreviations but also make it more domain specific with regards to India, and statistical surveys in India

example:
- Example Query: “How to calculate CPI?”
- Augmented Query: “How to calculate consumer price index (CPI) in India as per the Ministry guidelines.”

Semantic & Synonym expansion: Expand the query such that you use different synonyms of the query, also domain specific synonyms with regards to MoSPI, also expand any short-form to long-form and vice-versa
example:
    Example Query: “house”
    Expanded Query: “house OR home OR residence”

    Example Query: "West Bengal"
    Expanded Query: "West Bengal OR WB"

    Example Query: "Delhi NCR"
    Expanded Query: "Delhi NCR OR (Delhi AND Gurgaon AND Noida)"

Also expand the query to have an OR clause with hindi transcription of the final prompt, the hindi transcription should also have appropriate contextual expansion and synonym & semantic expansion

Your final response should only be the prompt, no extra keys, double-quotes or any other noise should be present

SQL_GENERATION_PROMPT = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You will be provided with a user query.
The queries you are executing is for a Statistical Database of Indian Surveys
Your goal is to generate a valid SQL query to provide the best answer to the user.

This is the table schema:
It is provided in the format of
-- table title: <which tells you what is the table, about and gives you some information about what each column might mean>
<the posgresql schema for the table>
Use this information together to get the most relevant table, & query it correctly
PROMPT: {query}
```sql
{schema}
```

Use this schema to generate as an output the SQL query. Ensure that the SQL query is null safe as some columns can be NULL
Try not to calculate values which are not required due to potential loss in precision due to float or double precision
Also all text fields can have values in any form, so utilise fuzzystrmatch package when you need to compare strings
```sql
-- This function calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings:
levenshtein(text source, text target, int ins_cost, int del_cost, int sub_cost) returns int
levenshtein(text source, text target) returns int
levenshtein_less_equal(text source, text target, int ins_cost, int del_cost, int sub_cost, int max_d) returns int
levenshtein_less_equal(text source, text target, int max_d) returns int
```
Always use levenshtein to match strings using a threshold of value `0.8`, to match the strings, only use it when it is required
Ensure that the query you write adheres to the schema given by me, and do not write any incorrect code, in case you do not find the correct column, use any combination of columsn which will be Semantically Correct

Can you make the sql query for the following prompt, only return the SQL query, nothing extra
